**MASSAlign** is a Python 2 library for the alignment and annotation of comparable documents.
It offers **3** main functionalities:

* Sentence-level alignment between comparable paragraphs or documents
* Word-level annotation of modification operations between aligned sentences

**MASSAlign** is excellent for extracting simplifications from complex/simple parallel documents!
